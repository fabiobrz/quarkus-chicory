## What's this?

Quarkus Chicory is a Quarkus extension that enables easy integration of [Chicory](https://github.com/dylibso/chicory) 
with Quarkus applications.

It provides easy management of multiple Wasm modules, either statically configured or dynamically loaded, via 
injectable beans.

Java bytecode generation, dynamic execution mode and transitive dependencies management are some of the features that 
you'll find, see more [here](./docs/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc), or just get started with some quick highlights!
